# DUVA - Frontend

Everything about DUVA


## Getting started

I suggest using pnpm

`pnpm install`

`pnpm dev` -  for running frontend.

`docker-compose up -d` - to start docker container with postgres and keycloak.

`http://localhost:8080` - UI for keycloak. User and Pass - admin - only for dev purpose.
